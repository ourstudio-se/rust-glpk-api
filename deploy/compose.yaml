# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:

  # Gurobi Solver - READ THIS BEFORE ENABLING
  # ==============================================================================
  #
  # IMPORTANT: Docker runs Linux containers, so macOS Gurobi won't work!
  #
  # For macOS users (development):
  #   Run Gurobi natively instead of in Docker:
  #   $ cd ..  # Go to project root
  #   $ GUROBI_HOME=/Library/gurobi1301/macos_universal2 SOLVER=gurobi \
  #     cargo run --features gurobi-solver
  #   Access at: http://localhost:9000
  #
  # For Linux servers (production):
  #   1. Download Linux Gurobi from https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/
  #   2. Extract to deploy/gurobi-linux/
  #   3. Ensure you have a valid license file
  #   4. Uncomment the service below
  #   5. See deploy/README-GUROBI.md for full instructions

  #     - GUROBI_HOME=/opt/gurobi
  #   volumes:
  #     # Mount Linux Gurobi installation (you must provide this)

  #     # Mount your Gurobi license file
  #     - ${HOME}/gurobi.lic:/opt/gurobi/gurobi.lic:ro

# The commented out section below is an example of how to define a PostgreSQL
# database that your application can use. `depends_on` tells Docker Compose to
# start the database before your application. The `db-data` volume persists the
# database data between container restarts. The `db-password` secret is used
# to set the database password. You must create `db/password.txt` and add
# a password of your choosing to it before running `docker compose up`.
#     depends_on:
#       db:
#         condition: service_healthy
#   db:
#     image: postgres
#     restart: always
#     user: postgres
#     secrets:
#       - db-password
#     volumes:
#       - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
#     environment:
#       - POSTGRES_DB=example
#       - POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db-password
